# OST â€¢ GraphQL Server
### Possibly the fastest way you can get started using crypto in your app.

Using [OST](https://ost.com) branded tokens you can set up a token economy inside any site/app/etc.  This is a small turn-key project that sets up a Node/Express development server running Apollo GraphQL so that you can ignore all the back end work while getting started developing front end services.

## Installation and Use
```Bash
cd ost-graphql-sandbox
npm install
vi logic/conf.js # add your OST API keys and Apollo service ID
npm start
# Server should be running on localhost:<GRAPHQL_PORT>/graphiql!
```
