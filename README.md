# OST â€¢ GraphQL Server
### Quite possibly the _fastest_ way you can get started using crypto in your app.

By using [OST](https://ost.com) branded tokens you can set up a token economy inside any site/app/etc.  This is a small turn-key project that sets up a Node/Express development server running Apollo GraphQL so that you can ignore all the back end work while getting started developing front end services.

GraphQL allows for your front end service to ask for exactly what information it wants, and get a clean response. Apollo has written some very nice documentation on how to use GraphQL from React, Vue, Angular, plain JS, etc.  [Give it a look](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/) when you are ready to learn more.

## Installation and Use
```Bash
cd ost-graphql-server
vi logic/conf.js # add your OST API keys and Apollo service ID
npm install
npm start
# Server should be running on localhost:<GRAPHQL_PORT>/graphiql!
```

This server comes with the basic OST APIs, but that is not where the fun stuff happens.  This project is set up so you can add your own API functions (resolvers) and types quickly. [```logic/type-defs.js```](https://github.com/Lastly/ost-graphql-server/blob/master/logic/type-defs.js) contains the type definitions for graphql, where the query and mutation types match the functions found in ```logic/resolvers.js```.  Take a look at [```logic/apis/ost.js```](https://github.com/Lastly/ost-graphql-server/blob/master/logic/apis/ost.js) to get an example of what a sample resolver looks like. Make your own file, add it to ```logic/resolvers.js```, and then add the matching types to ```logic/type-defs.js```.  Now you have an API -- Easy!
